## 🔍 Focus Areas

This repository will evolve as I learn. Here are some of the key topics I am actively exploring:

- 🧠 **Computer Vision**
  - Object detection, low-light and hazy image enhancement
- 🧰 **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
  - YOLOv8, YOLOv11, custom training and inference
- 🐍 **PyTorch**
  - Model implementation, training loops, datasets, transforms
- 📊 **COCO Format**
  - Dataset annotations, evaluation metrics, custom dataset conversion
- 🧪 **Experiments & Evaluation**
  - Running models under various conditions (low-light, haze, small object detection)
  - Using ExDark, RESIDE, VisDrone, and other datasets

## ✍️ How I Use This Repo

- I write notes as Markdown files and commit them as I learn.
- I include scripts and config files used for training and evaluation.
- I may add experiment results and observations over time.

## 📈 Goals

- Build intuition and practical skills in deploying and evaluating deep learning models.
- Create reproducible scripts for common workflows.
- Track growth and document insights over time.
