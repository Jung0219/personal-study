## ðŸ’¡ Lighting Conditions (10 Types)
Each image is labeled with one of the following lighting types:

| Type     | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Low**      | Extremely dark, minimal illumination, barely visible details. |
| **Ambient**  | Weak illumination, no visible light source. |
| **Object**   | Bright object in a dark scene, no visible light source. |
| **Single**   | Single visible light source (e.g., streetlight). |
| **Weak**     | Multiple but faint light sources. |
| **Strong**   | Multiple bright and visible light sources. |
| **Screen**   | Bright screen (e.g., TV or monitor) in indoor scenes. |
| **Window**   | Bright daylight from windows in indoor scenes. |
| **Shadow**   | Daylight scenes where subjects are in shadow. |
| **Twilight** | Taken during dawn or dusk with soft natural light. |
